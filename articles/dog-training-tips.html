        <h2>Getting Started with Dog Training</h2>
        <p>Training your dog doesn't have to be overwhelming. Here are some essential tips for beginners:</p>
        
        <h3>1. Start with Basic Commands</h3>
        <p>Begin with simple commands like "sit," "stay," "come," and "down." Keep training sessions short and positive.</p>

        <h3>2. Use Positive Reinforcement</h3>
        <p>Reward good behavior with treats, praise, and affection. This encourages your dog to repeat desired behaviors.</p>

        <h3>3. Be Consistent</h3>
        <p>Use the same commands and rewards consistently. Everyone in the household should follow the same training methods.</p>

        <h3>4. Practice Regularly</h3>
        <p>Short, frequent training sessions are more effective than long, infrequent ones.</p>
